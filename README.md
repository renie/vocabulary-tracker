# Vocabulary Tracker

Just a simple project using React to track down the words I've learned so far in Ukrainian

## Running at
[https://vocabulary-tracker.herokuapp.com/](https://vocabulary-tracker.herokuapp.com/)

## To change the words loaded
Update `public/words.json`

## Using it for other languages
For languages that use the Latin or Cyrillic alphabet, you don't have to change anything in the code to use this app. Just update the `public/words.json` and everything should work.

If you use other languages, you might have to change the font as well, to one that supports your language. You can do it by changing the imported font at the very beginning of `src/app.css`

## Running the project
```js
npm run dev
```

## Building the project
```js
npm run build
```
